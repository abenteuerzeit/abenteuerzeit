## Monolithic Architecture

The monolithic architecture pattern is a simple and easy-to-implement approach to building software systems. It involves building a single, self-contained application that contains all the functionality of the system. This pattern is best suited for small-scale web applications with a limited number of features and a small codebase.

### Benefits

- Easy to develop and deploy.
- Simple architecture that is easy to understand.

### Drawbacks:

- Scalability and maintainability issues as the codebase grows.
- Difficulties in testing and refactoring.

### Antipatterns

- Big Ball of Mud: An application that lacks a coherent structure and is difficult to maintain.

### Use Cases

- Simple web apps with small codebases.

### Best Practices

- Modularity, testing, and refactoring.

### Example Solution

- Online store

## Modular Monolith Architecture

The modular monolith architecture pattern is a variation of the monolithic architecture that involves breaking the system down into loosely coupled modules. Each module represents a vertical slice of the system and contains all the code required to implement a specific feature or use case. This pattern is best suited for complex applications with many business domains and features.

### Benefits

- Loosely coupled modules that are easier to maintain than a monolith.
- Easier to scale than a monolith.

### Drawbacks

- Slightly more complex than a monolith.

### Antipatterns

- Monolith in disguise: A modular monolith that tightly couples its modules and shares too much code.

### Use Cases

- Complex apps with many business domains and features.

### Best Practices:

- Vertical slices, domain-driven design, and dependency injection.

### Example Solution

- E-commerce platform. 

## Microservices Architecture

The microservices architecture pattern involves breaking down the system into a collection of independent, loosely coupled services that communicate with each other over a network. 

Each service is responsible for a specific functionality and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. 

This pattern is best suited for large-scale applications with high traffic volumes and diverse functionalities.

### Benefits

- Highly scalable and resilient due to the ability to scale individual services.
- Improved deployment speed due to independent service deployment.

### Drawbacks

- Increased complexity and operational costs due to distributed nature of the system.
